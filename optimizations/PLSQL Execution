How Does Oracle Execute PL/SQL Code?

PL/SQL runtime engine (a.k.a. PL/SQL Virtual Machine) is the database component that executes a
PL/SQL program’s bytecode. 
In this virtual machine, the bytecode of a PL/SQL program is translated to machine code 
that makes calls to the database server and returns results to the calling environment. 

The PVM itself is written in C. Historically, Oracle has included a PVM in some client-side tools such as Oracle Forms,
where the runtime engine opens a session to a remote database, communicating
with the SQL engine over a networking protocol.

Database session
-----------------
(server-side) PL/SQL, the database session is the process and memory
space associated with an authenticated user connection. 
Each session has its own memory area where it can hold an executing program’s data. 
Sessions begin with logon and end with logoff. 
The sessions connected to a database are visible through the view V$SESSION.
